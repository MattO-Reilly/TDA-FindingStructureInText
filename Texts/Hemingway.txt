(1899-4961)
hills like white elephants
the hills across the valley of the ebro were long and white
on this side there was no shade and no trees and the station was between two lines of rails in the sun
close against the side of the station there was the warm shadow of the building and a curtain made of strings of bamboo beads hung across the open door into the bar to keep out flies
The american and the girl with him sat at a table in the shade outside the building
it was very hot and the express from barcelona would come in forty minutes
it stopped at this junction for two minutes and went on to madrid
what should we drink the girl asked
she had taken off her hat and put it on the table
it's pretty hot the man said
let's drink beer
dos cervezas the man said into the curtain
big ones a woman asked from the doorway
yes two big ones
the woman brought two glasses of beer and two felt pads
she put the felt pads and the beer glasses on the table and looked at the man and the girl 
the girl was looking off at the line of hills
they were white in the sun and the country was brown and dry
they look like white elephants she said
i've never seen one the man drank his beer
no you wouldn't have
i might have the man said 
just because you say i wouldn't have doesn't prove anything
the girl looked at the bead curtain
they've painted something on it she said
what does it say
anis del toro
it's a drink
could we try it
the man called listen through the curtain
the woman came out from the bar
four reales
we want two anis del toro
with water
do you want it with water
i don't know the girl said
is it good with water
it's all right
you want them with water asked the woman
1 river in the north of spain.

yes with water
it tastes like licorice the girl said and put the glass down
that's the way with everything
yes said the girl 
everything tastes of licorice
Especially all the things you've waited so long for like absinthe
oh cut it out
you started it the girl said
i was being amused i was having a fine time
well let's try and have a fine time
all right i was trying
i said the mountains looked like white elephants 
wasn't that bright
that was bright
i wanted to try this new drink
that's all we do isn't it look at things and try new drinks
i guess so
the girl looked across at the hills
they're lovely hills she said
they don't really look like white elephants
i just meant the coloring of their skin through the trees
should we have another drink
all right
the warm wind blew the bead curtain against the table
the beer's nice and cool the man said
it's lovely the girl said
it's really an awfully simple operation jig the man said
it's not really an operation at all
the girl looked at the ground the table legs rested on
i know you wouldn't mind it jig 
it's really not anything it's just to let the air in
the girl did not say anything
i'll go with you and i'll stay with you all the time
they just let the air in and then it's all perfectly natural
then what will we do afterward we'll be fine afterward just like we were before
what makes you think so
that's the only thing that bothers us 
it's the only thing that's made us unhappy
the girl looked at the bead curtain put her hand out and took hold of two of the strings of beads
and you think then we'll be all right and be happy
i know we will
you don't have to be afraid
ive known lots of people that have done it so have i said the girl
and afterward they were all so happy
well the man said if you don't want to you don't have to
i wouldn't have you do it if you didn't want to but i know it's perfectly simple
and you really want to

i think it's the best thing to do
but i don't want you to do it if you don't really want to
and if I do it you'll be happy and things will be like they were and
you'll love me
i love you now
you know i love you
i know but if i do it then it will be nice again if i say things are like
white elephants and you'll like it
i'll love it i love it now but i just can't think about it
you know how i get when i worry
if i do it you won't ever worry
i won't worry about that because it's perfectly simple
then i'll do it 
because i don't care about me
what do you mean
i don't care about me
well i care about you
oh yes but i don't care about me 
and i'll do it and then everything will be fine
i don't want you to do it if you feel that way
the girl stood up and walked to the end of the station
across on the other side were fields of grain and trees along the banks of the ebro
far away beyond the river were mountains the shadow of a cloud moved
across the field of grain and she saw the river through the trees
and we could have all this she said
and we could have everything and every day we make it more impossible
what did you say
i said we could have everything
we can have everything
no we can't
we can have the whole world
no we can't
we can go everywhere
no we can't it isn't ours any more
it's ours
no it isn't And once they take it away you never get it back
but they haven't taken it away
we'll wait and see
come on back in the shade he said you mustn't feel that way 
i don't feel any way the girl said 
i just know things
i don't want you to do anything that you don't want to do
nor that isn't good for me she said
i know
could we have another beer
all right but you've got to realize
i realize the girl said can't we maybe stop talking
they sat down at the table and the girl looked across at the hills on the
dry side of the valley and the man looked at her and at the table
you've got to realize he said that i don't want you to do it if you don't want to
im perfectly willing to go through with it if it means any-thing to you
doesn't it mean anything to you we could get along
of course it does but i don't want anybody but you
i don't want any one else and i know it's perfectly simple
yes you know it's perfectly simple
it's all right for you to say that but I do know it
would you do something for me now
i'd do anything for you
would you please please please please please please please stop talking
he did not say anything but looked at the bags against the wall of the
station
there were labels on them from all the hotels where they had spent nights
but i don't want you to he said i don't care anything about it i'll scream the girl said
the woman came out through the curtains with two glasses of beer and
put them down on the damp felt pads
the train comes in five minutes she said
what did she say asked the girl
that the train is coming in five minutes
the girl smiled brightly at the woman to thank her
i'd better take the bags over to the other side of the station
the man said
she smiled at him
all right then come back and we'll finish the beer
he picked up the two heavy bags and carried them around the station to
the other tracks
he looked up the tracks but could not see the train coming back 
he walked through the barroom where people waiting for the train were drinking he drank an anis at the bar and looked at the people
they were all waiting reasonably for the train 
he went out through the bead curtain
she was sitting at the table and smiled at him
do you feel better he asked
i feel fine she said there's nothing wrong with me i feel fine
