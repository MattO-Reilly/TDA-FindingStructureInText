        <h1>Topological Data Analysis - Finding Structure In Text.</h1> </div>

    <div class='intro'>

        <p><b>Introduction:</b> 
        Topological Data Analysis (TDA) is a developing branch of data science which uses statistical learning and techniques from algebraic topology,
            such as persistent homology to study the data. In this project we will be using a range of topological techniques such as persistent homology,
            and Takens Embedding to determine the shape of each text and then concepts like the Bottleneck distance or the Wasserstein Distance
            to determine how similair any 2 graphs are. Another interesting problem was converting the text into a form the TDA techniques could more easily work with.
            TDA systems typically only operate on numerical data and so the sample texts can't be analysed in their original state.
            We managed to get around this problem by using the python library ntlk to convert the text into a more standard form and then using 
            the python library bag of  words to convert the text into a word count vector. </p>
        <p> This project hopes to uses topological techniques to compare different texts by the shape of their data and see how effective this is at categorising the different texts..</p>



    <div id="Background_Reading" class='Background_Reading'>
        <h1 style="color: crimson; text-align: center"> <u>Background Reading</u> </h1>
        <h3><u>What is a time series?</u></h3>
        <p> A time series is a collection of numerical data points that are measured at successive evenly spaced intervals of time and indexed in time order. 
        <br>

        Time series are made up of four components:
        <ol>
            <li>Trend variations - The predictable long-term pattern of the time series.</li>
            <li>Seasonal variations- Repeated behaviour in the data that occurs at regular intervals.</li>
            <li>Cyclical variations - Occurs when a series follows an up and down pattern that is not seasonal. </li>
            <li>Random variations – Do not fall under any of the above three classifications. </li>


        </ol></p>
        <p> Examples of time series include the continuous monitoring of a person’s heart rate, hourly readings of air temperature,
            daily closing price of a company stock, monthly rainfall data and yearly sales figures. </p>
    

        

        <h3><u> What is algebraic topology? </u></h3>
        <p>Algebraic topology uses methods from abstract algebra to answer topological questions by mapping spaces to algebraic objects.
            It uses abstract algebraic techniques like groups or rings, as many hole structures can be represented by these,
            to study objects and their properties that are homoeomorphic ie: invariant under continuous deformation. 
        <br>

        
        <ol>
            <li>Homotopy -   Two continuous functions from one topological space to another are called homotopic if one can be "continuously deformed" into the other</li>
            <li>Homology - Is a general way of associating a sequence of algebraic objects such as abelian groups or modules to other mathematical objects such as topological spaces. </li>
            <li>Cohomology - Cohomology can be viewed as a method of assigning richer algebraic invariants to a space than homology. </li>
            
        </ol>
        Homotopy, homology, and cohomology groups are the main areas of study in algebraic topology.
        In a very broad sense they attempt to capture the number of k-dimensional holes in a topological space. </p></div>

    <div id="SimplicialComplexs" class="SimplicialComplexs">
        <h3><u>Simplicial Complexs</u></h3>
        <p>Simplicial Complexes are defined as collections of simplices which satisfy the following conditions.
            <li>The complex must contain every face of any simplex belonging to it.</li>
            <li>Any simplices that overlap do so on a common face</li>
            <br>
            These simplicial complexes are often used To Triangulate Topological Spaces that they are Homeomorphic to, 
            However in Persistent Homology we use a special type called a Vietoris-Rips Complex.
            In these complexes two vertices x and y in a dataset are only connected by an edge if for an assigned value e the euclidean distance d(x,y) is less than e </p>
    </div>


    <div id="BettiNumbers" class="BettiNumbers">
        <h3> <u>Betti Numbers and Holes</u> </h3>
        <p>A hole in a mathematical object is a topological structure which prevents the object from being continuously shrunk to a point.
            When dealing with topological spaces, a disconnectivity is interpreted as a hole in the space.
        <br>
        <p>In algebraic topology, the Betti numbers are used to distinguish topological spaces based on the connectivity of n-dimensional simplicial complexes.</p>
        <p>Betti number: Bn = dim(ker(dn))-dim(image(dn+1)) </p>

        Informally, the kth Betti number refers to the number of k-dimensional holes on a topological surface. 
        The first few Betti numbers have the following definitions for 0-dimensional, 1-dimensional, and 2-dimensional simplicial complexes:

        
        <ol>
            <li>b0 is the number of connected components</li>
            <li>b1 is the number of one-dimensional or "circular" holes </li>
            <li>b2 is the number of two-dimensional "voids" or "cavities" </li>
            
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div id="PersistentHomology" class="PersistentHomology">
        <h3><u>What is persistent homology?</u> </h3>
        <p>Persistent homology is a method for computing topological features of a space at different spatial resolutions.
            More persistent features are detected over a wide range of spatial scales and are deemed more likely to represent true features
            of the underlying space rather than noise or choice of parameters. </p>
        

        
       
        <p> To find the persistent homology of a space, the space must first be represented as a simplicial complex.
            A distance function on the underlying space corresponds to a filtration of the simplicial complex, that is a nested sequence of increasing subsets. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="PersistenceDiagram">
        <h3><u>Bar Codes and Persistence Diagrams</u> </h3>
        <p>A bar code is a visual representation of the persistent homology where long bars represent features and short bars represent noise. </p>
        
        
       
        <p>A persistence diagram captures the birth and death of holes. The persistence diagram is very similar to the barcode.
            The x-coordinate of that point is when that point was born. The y-coordinate is when that feature died. 
            The distance between the 45 degree line and the point is the duration of the persistence for that feature.
            Features that were short lived occur close to the 45 degree line, while more persistent features occur at a greater distance from the 45 degree line.  </p>


        <h3><u>Takens' Theorem:</u></h3>
        <div class="Takens">
        <p><u><b>Takens' Theorem:</b></u>
        <br> Let \(M\) be a compact \(C^2\) differentiable manifold of dimension \(m\).
        Let \(\Phi: M \rightarrow M\) be a \(C^2\)  diffeomorphism and let \(\mu: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\) be any \(C^2\) map. It is a generic property that the mapping 
        \begin{equation}
        \Phi_{\phi, \mu}: M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{2 m+1}, x \mapsto\left(\mu(x), \mu \phi(x), \mu \phi^{2}(x), \ldots, \mu \phi^{2 m}(x)\right)
        \end{equation}
        is an embedding.</p></div>

        <p>Takens’ embedding theorem states that we can reconstruct a time series considering time delays. 
            A series can be reconstructed in phase space where m is the embedding dimension (the smallest dimension required to embed an object) and t the time delay.
            Thus, instead of analysing the series along time, we analyse its trajectory as a set of visited states in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. #
            This is particularly useful to extract the topological behaviour we are interested in. </p>

        <p> In the study of dynamical systems, a delay embedding theorem gives the conditions under which a chaotic dynamical system can be reconstructed 
            from a sequence of observations of the state of a dynamical system. The reconstruction preserves the properties of the dynamical system 
            that do not change under smooth coordinate changes (i.e., diffeomorphisms), but it does not preserve the geometric shape of structures in phase space. </p>

    <div id="Beetles" class="Beetles">

        <h2><u> Example 1: Beetles</u></h2>
        <p>Our aim was to compare results with a paper written by Cássio M.M. Pereira and Rodrigo F. de Mello entitled "Persistent homology for time series and spatial data clustering"
        <br>
        Their paper was concerned with analysing Time Series Data with Persistent Homology, K Means was used as a control to show comparative results of a less accurate method. </p>

        <p> Our Experiment was interested in if we could clasify Time Series Data with Persistent Homology more efficiently than K-Means. The two classifications were Stable and Aperiodic. We used the same Beetle model data from *Pereira and *Mello to compare our results with them.</p>

        <p>We used R to programme our results. These are some Libraries we used to analyse our Data in R.</p>
